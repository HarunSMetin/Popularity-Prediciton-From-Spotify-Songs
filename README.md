In this project I aimed to predict Popularity from Spotify Songs Features.

I used Regression models to get result between 1-100,
then I change the Popularity values to Labels like 
  - 0-25 ==> 1. class
  - 25-50 ==> 2. class
  - 50-75 ==> 3. class
  - 75-100 ==> 4. class
  
So used Classification Models too.

You can see Acurracy Scores in Python Notebook page.

PS: Dataset is bigger than 25 mb I cant upload.
